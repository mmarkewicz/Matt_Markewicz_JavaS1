# Summative Assessment: Relational Data

This project involves the creation of a Java DAO for an existing database structure.

## Structure
Your solution must have the following structural elements:

* Your solution must be in an IntelliJ project called ```FirstnameLastU1M5Summative``` where Firstname and Lastname are your first and last name respectively.
* Your solution must use JdbcTemplates and prepared statements.
* Your solution must contain a full set of unit/integration tests.

## Methodology

* You must utilize TDD and Red Green Refactor when developing this project.
* You must use Pivotal Tracker to track your tasks for this project.

## Requirements/Features

This project is a DAO and relational database that keeps track of books in a bookstore. 

* Your DAO API must allow callers to create, read, read all, update, and delete Books, Authors, and Publishers in the system. The system must also allow callers to find Books by Author.
* Your solution must be based on the database created by the following SQL script:

```sql
create schema if not exists book_store;
use book_store;

create table if not exists book (
	book_id int not null auto_increment primary key,
    isbn varchar (15) not null,
    publish_date date not null,
    author_id int not null,
    title varchar (70) not null,
    publisher_id int not null,
    price decimal(5,2) not null
);

create table if not exists author (
	author_id int not null auto_increment primary key,
    first_name varchar(50) not null,
    last_name varchar(50) not null,
    street varchar(50) not null,
    city varchar(50) not null,
    state char(2) not null,
    postal_code varchar(25) not null,
    phone varchar(15) not null,
    email varchar(60) not null
);

create table if not exists publisher (
	publisher_id int not null auto_increment primary key,
    name varchar(50)not null,
    street varchar(50) not null,
    city varchar(50) not null,
    state char(2) not null,
    postal_code varchar(25) not null,
    phone varchar(15) not null,
    email varchar(60) not null
);

/* Foreign Keys: book */
alter table book add constraint fk_book_author foreign key (author_id) references author(author_id);
alter table book add constraint fk_book_publisher foreign key (publisher_id) references publisher(publisher_id);
```

# Reflection Questions

#### What was the most difficult part of this model?
Determining the relationships between entities.

#### What change along the way presented the biggest challenge?
Normalizing entities to eliminate functional dependencies.

#### How difficult or easy was it to change your model midstream?
It was challenging changing the relationships between entities, because the effects usually cascaded throughout the model. Any time we changed the model, we had to account for it in one or more dependent entities.

#### Where there any columns on which your team didn't agree on a data type?
No, we planned out the data types of each entity before modeling.

#### Why is it important to have a good understanding of the underlying business when creating a data model?

#### Compare and contrast data and metadata.
Data represents the specific values that are being tracked by businesses. Metadata, in a relational database sense, are the values of the columns in databases. Metadata does not hold specific pieces of data, but rather a category of data that will be accessible in that column. 

#### What is the difference between an entity and an attribute?
An entity is a grouping of metadata and data points that are relevant to a specific piece of information. An entity can be composed of many columns and rows, whereas an attribute is a specific column within an entity. An entity can have many attributes, but an attribute can only belong to one entity.

#### What is a primary key?
A primary key is a unique value for each entry in a table. This key must be unique to the specific entry, no duplicates.

#### What is a foreign key?

#### What is the purpose of relationships in a relational database?
Entities can have certain relationships to better organize data in an intuitive way. Data can be compared/organized across various entities to create a web of related information.

#### What does a row represent in a relational database?
A row represents an entry in a relational database. Each entry is composed of columns that describe specific data points that correspond to the metadata of the entity.
